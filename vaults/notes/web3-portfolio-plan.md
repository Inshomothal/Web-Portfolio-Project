# Web3 / Full‑Stack Portfolio Plan (2025–2028)

## 🎯 Objective

- Graduate with a B.A. in Computer Science from Cal State Dominguez Hills.  
- Build a portfolio that demonstrates skills needed for full‑stack Web2 or Web3 roles, even as AI becomes widely used.  
- Include projects that combine Web3 (blockchain, smart contracts, decentralization) with modern Web2 / full‑stack practices — and optionally integrate AI where it adds value (e.g. automation, analytics, tooling).  
- Use the portfolio + GitHub + live demos + documentation to make yourself competitive for Web3 or Web2 companies, or as a stepping-stone to launching your own Web3‑AI startup later.

## ✅ Why This Plan Matches Market & Future Trends

- Demand for Web3 roles remains strong: companies are hiring Smart Contract Developers, Full-Stack Web3 Devs, Rust developers (for non-EVM chains), Web3 Security Engineers, AI + Web3 engineers, etc. [^1]  
- For Web3, core skills employers expect include smart contract languages (especially Solidity), blockchain fundamentals, full-stack Web3 tooling (JS/TS + Web3.js/Ethers.js + frameworks), and decentralized infra like IPFS. [^2]  
- AI is increasingly shaping web and full-stack development: automating repetitive tasks, helping with testing, deployment, UI/UX, and enabling data-driven features. [^5]  
- Modern employers value not only technical fundamentals but also open-source contributions, real delivered code, and demonstrated initiative. [^7]  

Given that, this plan balances Web3 fundamentals, full‑stack web dev, and AI‑augmented development — giving you flexibility to target Web2, Web3, or hybrid roles.

## 🔧 Skills & Knowledge Roadmap  

To execute the projects above and stay competitive, you should build or strengthen skills in the following areas:

### Core Technical Skills

- **Smart contract development** — Solidity (for EVM chains), plus familiarity with tools like Hardhat or Foundry for testing, deployment, and contract management. [^4]  
- **Web3 stack & blockchain fundamentals** — Understanding how blockchains work, transaction flows, gas costs, EVM vs non-EVM, decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS), consensus, decentralization trade-offs. [^3]  
- **Full-stack web development** — Frontend (React or Next.js, JS/TS, responsive design, UX), backend (Node.js / Express or other), database knowledge (SQL or NoSQL), REST / GraphQL APIs, authentication/user management. Helps you target Web2 or hybrid roles. [^6]  
- **Integration skills** — Connecting blockchain + smart-contracts with UI via Web3 libraries (Web3.js, Ethers.js, wagmi, etc.), building dApps end-to-end. [^14]  
- **Testing, security & auditing** — For smart contracts: tests, understanding vulnerabilities, gas optimisation, safe patterns. [^10]  
- **AI / ML / Automation skills (optional but recommended)** — Use AI for tooling (code generation, auditing), data analytics, AI-powered features (dashboards, chatbots), or automation of repetitive tasks. This matches emerging trends where AI augments web development work. [^9]  

### Soft Skills / Meta‑Skills / Professional Traits

- **Version control & open-source collaboration** — Use Git/GitHub for all projects; contribute to open-source to show collaboration and initiative. Employers increasingly value open-source contributions from students. [^7]  
- **Documentation & communication** — Write clear READMEs, project docs, maybe blog posts — helps demonstrate thought process, project purpose, trade­offs.  
- **Problem-solving, system design, architectural thinking** — Especially important if integrating AI + Web3 or targeting backend/infra-heavy roles. As AI automates some tasks, human designers/architects matter more. [^8]  
- **Adaptability & continuous learning** — Web3 and AI evolve fast. Be ready to learn new tools, frameworks, languages (e.g. Rust), or adapt to new blockchain trends. [^13]  
- **Product and user‑centric thinking** — Build apps with UX, usability, real user flows — not just technical demos. This is valuable for Web2 or hybrid roles too.

## 🛠️ How to Present Your Portfolio to Employers or Recruiters

- **Use a central “Portfolio Website”** (see Project #12) as your landing page — list your projects with brief summaries, tech stack, links to live demos (if possible), link to GitHub repos.  
- **Write good README & documentation for each project** — Describe what the project does, why you built it, what technologies you chose, what you learned or what problems you solved.  
- **Live deployments & demos if feasible** — For dApps or web apps, hosting on testnet, using platforms like Vercel/Netlify, so recruiters can click and try.  
- **Include tests, CI/CD, and security/audit where relevant** — Demonstrates professionalism, attention to detail, and real‑world readiness (especially for Web3).  
- **If using AI or building AI‑powered features, explain clearly what AI does and why** — Show that you’re not using “AI for buzz,” but thoughtfully integrating AI where it adds real value.  
- **Show growth and learning** — If early projects were simpler (e.g. CRUD web apps), and later ones more advanced (dApps + AI), that shows progression and increasing competence.  
- **Contribute to open‑source or collaborate with others** — Having PRs, merged code, contributions helps demonstrate teamwork, collaboration, and code readability — desirable by employers.

## 📅 Suggested Timeline (2025–2028)

- **2025 (Now – End of Year):** Work on full‑stack Web2 app (project #9), portfolio website (#12), and maybe start simple dApp (NFT marketplace #1).  
- **2026:** Build more Web3‑oriented projects — NFT marketplace, decentralized identity or auth (#4), and learn smart contract testing + deployment.  
- **2026–2027:** Expand to more advanced / hybrid / AI‑integrated projects: AI‑augmented DeFi tracker (#5), AI‑powered smart contract auditor or assistant (#3/#7), hybrid Web2/Web3‑AI app (#10).  
- **2027:** Polish portfolio, contribute to open-source, maybe real‑world deployment (testnets or mainnet if feasible), deploy portfolio website, write documentation & blog posts, start applying for Web3 / full‑stack Web2 roles.  
- **Beyond Graduation (2027–2028):** Keep learning new tools/technologies (e.g. Rust, newer blockchain ecosystems), build more advanced projects, maintain and expand portfolio — or begin working on a startup/business using Web3 + AI skills.  

---

## 📌 Additional Notes / Strategies

- Focus first on **strong fundamentals** — solid full‑stack web dev + one Web3 project — then gradually layer complexity (smart contracts, blockchain, AI). This gives flexibility: you can apply to Web2 jobs if Web3 is slow, or vice versa.  
- Make use of open-source contributions to show real collaboration and initiative (not just solo “tutorial-like” projects). According to recent research, employers regard open-source contributions as important signals for hireability. [^7]  
- Treat AI as a **tool** — not a crutch. Use it to augment work (testing, generation, data analysis, UX suggestions) — but maintain strong understanding yourself. As AI automates more, human creativity, system design, architecture, security awareness become more valuable. [^9]  
- Keep up with evolving Web3 ecosystems: more chains, Layer‑2, cross-chain, new frameworks. Be ready to adapt — that’s part of the value you bring.
